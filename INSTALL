The generic simulation cell class is a header only library
so installation consists of placing the files in the source
directory somewhere where your compiler can find them.
Alternatively you can include that directory in the compiler
search path with -I .../gensimcell/source.

A compiler with support for C++11 or at least variadic
template parameters is required.
